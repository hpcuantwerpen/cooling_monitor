Miniscripts in the experiments folder
=====================================

These scripts are usually designed to run on themselves, so simply execute
them:
./miniscriptXX.pl


Main code in monitor
====================

This code cannot easily be tested from a local desktop since it is not easily
feasible to create the necessary port forwarding and IP routing on the desktop.
Hence this code should be tested on the login nodes of the cluster, which is 
why we developed it in en Eclipse synchronized project even if PTP is not
really designed to work well with Perl.

There is also a test setup on the vsc20001 account, located in
cd /data/antwerpen/200/vsc20001/test-cooling-monitor

Fetching test data
------------------

It is best to start from recent copies of the data files from the actively 
running code. This is particularly important for the short logs as they are 
used to generate the graphs through GNUplot and changes to the GNUplot code
can only be tested well with a reasonably complete data set. It is currently
less important for the full logs as the code will nicely start new logs if it
doesn't find an existing log file for the current data set. 
* Note that the monitoring does not always run on the same master node of 
  Hopper. We need to take that into account when fetching the data! The best 
  is to use the IP address 10.28.236.8.
* The data files are in /opt/icinga/cooling/data
* Make your life easy and start an ssh agent first with a key that gives access
  to the vsc20001 account.
* Then you can use the get_testdata.sh script in the project directory to fetch
  the data from the install directory on the cluster master node. Add YYmm to 
  also fetch the full log files for that month.

ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cluster_UAntwerpen
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cluster_UAntwerpen vsc20001@10.28.236.8:/opt/icinga/cooling/data/cooler01.data data
./get_testdata.sh 1601

Setting up a web server on the login nodes and proxy on the laptop
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Login with ssh while creating a tunnel:
  An easy way to avoid much typing is to define a host in .ssh/config:

  Host ho-webproxy
      Hostname login4-hopper.uantwerpen.be
      User vsc20259
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cluster_UAntwerpen
      LocalForward localhost:8888 localhost:8888

  All you then need is simply ssh ho-webproxy

* Go to the web page directory, e.g. ${VSC_DATA}/Monitor/V2/www

* Start a python SimpleHTTPServer web server on port 8888 (the port chosen with 
  ssh above) via the script start_webserver (the 8888 is hard-coded in that script!)

cd ${VSC_DATA}/Monitor/V2/www
./start_webserver

  The script is needed since otherwise SipleHTTPServer doesn't serve the
  svg pictures with the correct mime type.
  
* Now simply open a browser on the laptop and surf to localhost:8888

The alternative is to use the proxy mechanism that is also used to access
the web interfaces of the iLO's etc. on the cluster and then use the
URL 10.28.236.13:8888 assuming the SimpleHTTPServer runs on login4 of
Hopper, port 8888.



Running the code
----------------

* You'll need to login again as the web proxy is blocking the other shell.

* You'll need recent versions of perl and gnuplot. We tested with Perl 5.20, 
  and gnuplot 5.0 is the minimum for gnuplot.
  
module load hopper/2015a
module load Perl/5.20.1-intel-2015a
module load gnuplot/5.0.0-intel-2015a
  
* Then all you need to do is to go to ${VSC_DATA}/Monitor/V2/monitor
  and run getdata.pl
  
cd ${VSC_DATA}/Monitor/V2/monitor
./getdata.pl
